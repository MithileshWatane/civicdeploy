## MVC Architecture
CivicConnect follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. In the backend, models are defined for users, projects, issues, and government authorities, which interact with the database.
  
- **View**: The user interface of the application. In the frontend, React components serve as views, rendering the UI and displaying data to users.

- **Controller**: Handles user input and interacts with the model. In the backend, controllers manage the logic for processing requests, interacting with models, and returning responses.
